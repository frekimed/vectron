# vectron
Vectorized stencils of Victron Energy products

Created in Xara Xtreme Pro 5 vector editor.
Files with an "S" in the filename are fully 'converted to curves'.
.SVG is "scalable vector graphics" format, able to import to draw.io (but with issues, TBD later)
.VSSX - stencils for MS Visio, created in version 2019, but (maybe)will work in other versions of Visio too.
